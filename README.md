Personal Task Manager (Console Application) â€” Interview Preparation Notes
Project Overview:
Name: Personal Task Manager (Console-Based)

Technology Stack: Java (console app), MySQL, JDBC

Purpose: Manage personal tasks from the command line with features to add, update, delete, and view tasks.

Features:
Text-based menu-driven interface for ease of use

CRUD operations on tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Task attributes: Task ID, Title, Description, Priority, Due Date, Status

Persistent storage using MySQL database

Input validation and error handling in console input

Architecture & Components:
Main class: Handles the console UI, displays menu options, reads user input

Task model: Represents task data (ID, title, description, priority, due date, status)

Database Access Object (DAO): Manages JDBC connections and SQL operations

DBConnection utility: Establishes and provides database connection

TaskService: Contains business logic between UI and DAO

Sample Code Snippets:
Main Menu Loop:

java
Copy
Edit
while(true) {
    System.out.println("1. Add Task");
    System.out.println("2. View Tasks");
    System.out.println("3. Update Task");
    System.out.println("4. Delete Task");
    System.out.println("5. Exit");
    int choice = scanner.nextInt();
    // Switch-case for operations
}
Database Connection:

java
Copy
Edit
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/taskdb", "root", "password");
Insert Task:

java
Copy
Edit
String sql = "INSERT INTO tasks(title, description, priority, due_date, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, task.getTitle());
pstmt.setString(2, task.getDescription());
// set other fields
pstmt.executeUpdate();
Retrieve Tasks:

java
Copy
Edit
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM tasks");
while(rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getInt("id") + " - " + rs.getString("title"));
}
Interview Questions You May Face:
How does your console app handle invalid inputs?

Explain how you manage database connections and resource closing.

How did you implement update and delete functionality?

What SQL queries are used for CRUD?

How would you improve this console app into a full web application?

Potential Improvements:
Add user authentication for multi-user support

Implement search and filter functionalities

Add due date reminders or alerts

Convert the console app into a desktop or web app using frameworks like Swing or Spring Boot

Introduce logging and exception handling improvements
